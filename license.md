About
-----
CocoaCryptoHashing is a very simple and lightweight collection of MD5/SHA1
functions for Cocoa (which sadly does not contain any of these by default). It
provides two categories on both `NSString` and `NSData`. The header file is
pretty well documented, so getting started should not be a problem.

Requirements
------------
You will need Cocoa (and more specifically, Foundation), in order to use
this. OpenSSL is required as well, but since Mac OS X comes with it by
default, this should not be a problem.

Building
--------
Depending on the platform and the target, you may need different linker flags.
On 10.5 and on the iPhone platform, `-lcrypto` should be enough; on 10.4 you
may need to use both `-lcrypto` and `-lssl`.

License
-------
CocoaCryptoHashing is licensed under the modified BSD license. This license is
included in the COPYING file.

  LICENSE ISSUES 
  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
