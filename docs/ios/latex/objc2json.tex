Objective-\/\+C types are mapped to J\+S\+O\+N types in the following way\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item N\+S\+Null -\/$>$ null \item N\+S\+String -\/$>$ string \item N\+S\+Array -\/$>$ array \item N\+S\+Dictionary -\/$>$ object \item N\+S\+Number\textquotesingle{}s -\/init\+With\+Bool\+:Y\+E\+S -\/$>$ true \item N\+S\+Number\textquotesingle{}s -\/init\+With\+Bool\+:N\+O -\/$>$ false \item N\+S\+Number -\/$>$ number\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyNote}{覚え書き}
In J\+S\+O\+N the keys of an object must be strings. N\+S\+Dictionary keys need not be, but attempting to convert an N\+S\+Dictionary with non-\/string keys into J\+S\+O\+N will throw an exception.
\end{DoxyNote}
N\+S\+Number instances created with the -\/number\+With\+Bool\+: method are converted into the J\+S\+O\+N boolean \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}false\char`\"{} values, and vice versa. Any other N\+S\+Number instances are converted to a J\+S\+O\+N number the way you would expect.
